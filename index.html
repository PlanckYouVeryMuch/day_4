    <p>Cindy Winner Djankeu Ngamba is a Cameroonian boxer who competes for the EOC Refugee Team and Refugee Olympic Teams in middleweight divisions.</p>
    <p>Ngamba was born in Cameroon but came to the UK at the age of 11. At the age of 18, she came out as a lesbian, consequently she has no desire to return to Cameroon, where homosexuality is illegal.</p>
    <p>Ngamba earned a BA (Hons) degree in Crime and Criminal Justice from the University of Bolton.</p>
    <p>Ngamba trains with GB Boxing, although cannot represent Great Britain due to not holding a British passport.</p>
    <p>In 2023, she won a Bocskai event in Hungary in the under 75 kg event for the EOC Refugee Team at the 2023 European Games. In 2024, she went on to win the British National Amateur Championships in three different weight categories, the first woman to do so since Natasha Jones in 2009. </p>
    <p>On the 2nd of May 2024, Ngamba was officially named as the first boxer selected for the Refugee Olympic Team. She was also chosen as a flag-bearer for the Refugee Olympic Team alongside Yahya Al-Ghotany, a Taekwondo competitor from Syria. </p>
    <p>At the Paris 2024 Olympic games, Ngamba won the bronze medal in the Women’s 75kg boxing, becoming the first athlete to win an Olympic medal for the Refugee Olympic Team. </p>

            <p>Ivor Novello, born David Ivor Davies, was a Welsh actor, composer and playwright known for romantic musicals.</p>
            <p>The son of celebrated singing teacher Dame Clara Novello, Ivor developed a love of music and theatre from an early age. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford. After leaving school he moved to a flat above the Strand theatre in Aldwych, which would play host to Noel Coward, Somerset Maugham, Paul Robeson and Siegfried Sassoon. </p>
            <p>He then served with the Royal Naval Air Service during World War I. He first gained fame at the age of 21 during the war with the patriotic song ‘Keep the Home Fires Burning’.</p>
            <p>In 1916, he met the actor Bobby Andrews, the pair became friends and later lovers, staying together for 35 years. The pair performed together many times in Novello’s musicals and plays.</p>
            <p>Novello wrote and starred in his first play ‘The Rat’ in 1924 and its later film adaptation. </p>
            <p>For the next two decades he continued to write and star in musicals and several film roles, notably a sinister suspected serial killer in the Alfred Hitchcock film ‘The Lodger’.</p>
            <p>However, in 1944, Novello’s life would take a turn in 1944 after he went to prison for 4 weeks, though he was sentenced to 8, for misuse of petrol coupons and attempting to bribe a police officer.</p>
            <p>However, he still remained popular as a matinee idol for his dark, handsome looks, glamour and sentimentalism. </p>
            <p>On the 6th March 1951, Novello died of coronary thrombosis. His funeral was attended by 7000 people attended his funeral with woman outnumbering men 50 to 1.</p>
            <p>In the 1950s the Ivor Novello Awards, presented by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters, began rewarding British songwriters and composers.</p>

            <h2>Svante Pääbo(1955-present) </h2>

                <p>Svante Pääbo is a Swedish geneticist and Nobel Laureate known as one of the fathers of paleogenetics and for sequencing the Neanderthal genome. </p>
                <p>Pääbo was born in Stockholm to Estonian chemist Karin Pääbo and Swedish biochemist Sune Bergström, the result of an extra-marital affair.</p>
                <p>In 1975, Pääbo began studying at Uppsala University. In 1986, he would earn his Ph.D. for research investigating how the E19 protein of adenoviruses modulates the immune system. </p>
                <p>From 1986 to 1987, he did postdoctoral research at the Institute for Molecular Biology II, University of Zurich. Following this he moved to the United States as a post-doctoral researcher in biochemistry at the University of California, where he began working on sequencing the genome of extinct animals.</p>
                <p>He would return to Europe in 1990 as a professor of general biology at the University of Munich and in 1997 became the founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig.</p>
                <p>In 1997, Pääbo and his colleagues reported success in sequencing the Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), from a specimen found in Feldhofer grotto, Germany. </p>
                <p>In 2002, he published findings about the ‘language gene’, FOXP2, which is mutated in some individuals with language- based disabilities.</p>
                <p>In 2009, the Institute completed the first draft version of the Neanderthal genome, sequencing over 3 billion base pairs. </p>
                <p>In 2010, Pääbo and his co-workers published a report about the DNA analysis of a finger bone found in Siberia, that suggested that the bone belong to a not yet recognised member of the genus Homo, the Denisova hominin.</p>
                <p>Pääbo and his colleagues published the draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome in the journal ‘Science’, concluding that there was probably interbreeding between Neanderthals and Eurasian humans, a theory that has since gained mainstream support in the scientific community. </p>
                <p>In 2014, Pääbo published ‘Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes’, a mixed memoir and popular science, that tells the story of the research effort to map the Neanderthal genome.He wrote in this book that he is bisexual.
                </p>
                <p>In 2020, Pääbo work on research that determined that increased incidence of vulnerability to and hospitalisation as a result of COVID – 19 was associated with European Neanderthal heritage.</p>
                <p>Pääbo has been the recipient of many scientific awards throughout his career, including the Gruber Prize in Genetics (2013), Dan David Prize (2017) and most significantly the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for sequencing the Neanderthal Genome. </p>
                <blockquote><cite>"The dirty little secret of genomics is that we still know next to nothing about how a genome translates into the particularities of a living and breathing individual."
